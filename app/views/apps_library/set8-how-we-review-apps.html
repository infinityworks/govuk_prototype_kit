                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="what-we-assess">What we assess</h3>
                <p>Our Digital Assessment Questions make sure only safe, secure and effective apps are hosted on the NHS Apps Library. Any product submitted must pass our tests for eligibility, clinical safety, data protection, security and usability, and that anyone using them will benefit from improved health and wellbeing.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="pre-qualification">Pre-qualification</h3>
                <p>Developers must answer our pre-qualification questions before they can put their app forward for full assessment and be considered for the NHS Apps Library.</p>
                <p>We currently focus on apps that help with social care, cancer, maternity, mental health or long-term conditions such as asthma and diabetes.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="eligibility">Eligibility </h3>
                <p>Our eligibility questions are used to find out what an app actually does. We ask how it helps users to treat or manage their condition and who might use it as part of their treatment. </p>
                <p>All apps must have approval from the correct regulatory body, for example the Medicines and Healthcare Products <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency/about" target="_blank">Regulatory Agency</a>, which makes sure that medical devices work and are safe to use. </p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="evidence-of-outcomes">Evidence of Outcomes</h3>
                <p>These questions make sure all apps are doing what they are designed to do, and we ask developers to show us how their app improves health and wellbeing. For example, if an app is designed to help patients with their mental health, developers must give examples of how it could, or already has, helped people.</p>
                <p>We also ask how an app can assist the NHS in areas like reducing waiting times and reducing the need for doctor’s appointments, as well as making sure there is a demand for the services the app offers.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="clinical-safety">Clinical Safety</h3>
                <p>Our clinical safety questions make sure developers have taken all appropriate action to keep safe any patients using their app. For example, with an app that reminds patients to take their medication, developers must provide evidence that shows any risk of these reminders being incorrect has been completely removed or made as low as possible.</p>
                <p>Developers of any app that could put a user at risk must meet the safety standards required by the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/solution-assurance/the-clinical-safety-team/clinical-risk-management-standards" target="_blank">Health and Social Care Act 2012</a>. This would mean producing Hazard Logs and Safety Case Reports, which would be reviewed by experts at NHS Digital.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="data-protection">Data Protection</h3>
                <p>Our data protection questions are designed to make sure that any personal information collected or shared by an app is handled in a safe, fair and lawful way.  </p>
                <p>Developers must provide details of where the data collected is stored and tell users what rights they have to control how their information is used.  </p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="security">Security</h3>
                <p>These questions seek to understand the security controls in an app that are relied on to protect your data and device. Among other things, we check an app only asks for the information it really needs to work for you, that installing it won’t put your device at risk and that your information is handled and stored securely. </p>
                <p>Developers must prove that their apps follow good security practices, so we can be sure they are safe to use.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="usability">Usability &amp; Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Our usability and accessibility questions help us make sure apps are easy to understand and use. Text must be easy to read, and action buttons must be easy to press, clearly marked and do exactly what users expect them to do.</p>
                <p>Apps are assessed to make sure they provide access to as many people as possible, including older users, younger users and those with disabilities. This might mean the app being able to increase text size where needed and work with voice software to help visually impaired people.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="interoperability">Interoperability</h3>
                <p>Our interoperability questions test how well an app exchanges data with other systems. For example, how it connects with a patient’s medical record or collects readings from another device such as a smart watch or blood pressure monitor. This process helps developers use data within the app to build new functions, benefiting users. </p>
                <p>Not all apps exchange data, but developers of those that do must meet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/info-revolution/interoperability/open-api" target="_blank">NHS England’s rules on access to data</a>. These rules make the sharing process simple while also keeping it safe and secure.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading-medium" id="technical-stability">Technical Stability</h3>
                <p>The technical stability questions are used to understand how an app has been tested and how testing will continue over time. Developers must show how patients can report any problems with an app and how they will work to sort out those problems. </p>
                <p>These questions also cover what happens to any patient information an app has collected if the patient stops using the app or the app is shut down by the developer.</p>
